# Frontend App

This frontend was created with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors (if any) appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder with optimized assets.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back.

## Notes

- Environment variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` to be exposed to the app.
- For environment variables, copy your values into `../frontend/.env` (or `.env.local`).
